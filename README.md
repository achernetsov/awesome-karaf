List of stuff about Apache Karaf

# What is Karaf

From [official documentation](https://karaf.apache.org/manual/latest/):

Apache Karaf is a modern polymorphic application container.

Karaf can be used as a standalone container, supporting a wide range of applications and technologies. It also supports the "run anywhere" concept (on any machine with Java, cloud, docker images, …​) using the embedded mode.

It’s a lightweight, powerful, and enterprise ready platform.

With this flexibility, Karaf is the perfect solution for microservices, systems integration, big data, and much more.

Apache Karaf is powered by OSGi (but you don’t need to know what OSGi is to use Karaf).

Apache Karaf uses either the Apache Felix or Eclipse Equinox OSGi frameworks, providing additional features on top of the framework.

Apache Karaf can be scaled from a very lightweight container to a fully featured enterprise service: it’s a very flexible and extensible container, covering all the major needs.
